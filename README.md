## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
set_of_words = set()
for word in preprocessed_corpus[0].split():
 set_of_words.add(word)
vocab = list(set_of_words)
print(vocab)

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This NLP Python book is for anyone looking to learn NLPâ€™s theoretical and practical aspects alike. It starts with the basics and gradually covers advanced concepts to make it easy to follow for readers with varying levels of NLP proficiency. This comprehensive guide will help you develop a thorough understanding of the NLP methodologies for building linguistic applications; however, working knowledge of Python programming language and high school level mathematics is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 2-11).
